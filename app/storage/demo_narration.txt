Hi everyone. We are building HT Content Multiplier, an AI system that turns one news article into 15 plus publish‑ready assets in under two minutes, with newsroom‑grade quality. The problem is simple: HT publishes more than 100 articles daily, but only a handful become videos, podcasts, or social posts because manual conversion takes hours and costs serious money. Our system collapses that workflow into a parallel, automated pipeline that preserves editorial quality and brand voice.

Here is the flow. We start with one article. The system runs a structured analysis to extract the headline, category, tone, key facts, quotes, entities, and narrative arc. Then it launches parallel pipelines for video, audio, social, Hindi translation, SEO, and QA. Each pipeline is modular, tracked in a job queue, retried on failure, and logged with cost and status. Results are persisted in SQLite and exposed in a Streamlit dashboard with live progress.

Let me show the demo. I am running the system in demo mode with a market article about Q3 results for major banks. First, on the input screen, I can paste text, provide a URL, or upload a file. For the demo, it auto‑loads the article and immediately starts analysis. You will see the progress bar and each pipeline status move from pending to done as the tasks finish in parallel.

The analysis step captures the essential facts that downstream pipelines rely on. This ensures the outputs stay faithful to the article and that all claims can be traced. You can see the structured JSON that includes the headline, category, tone, and a clear narrative arc. This makes the system explainable and safe for editorial use.

Now the output dashboard shows the content package. In the Video tab, we create a 60‑second script with a strong hook, a concise body, and a clean call to action. In free mode, the system generates a placeholder video using FFmpeg. In production mode, we would call D‑ID to generate a realistic anchor video. The script itself is fully ready for broadcast.

In the Audio tab, we generate a three to five minute podcast‑style narration. In free mode, we use local TTS. In production, we use a natural Indian English voice. We also generate an audiogram for social distribution.

In the Social tab, you can see platform‑specific posts: a Twitter thread, a LinkedIn article, Instagram carousel copy, a Facebook post, and a WhatsApp summary. Each format has its own structure and length constraints, and the outputs follow a consistent HT newsroom voice.

In the Hindi tab, the system produces a culturally adapted translation that preserves named entities. If Hindi voice is enabled, we also generate a voiceover for regional audiences.

In the SEO tab, we deliver headline variants, meta descriptions, FAQs, and keywords. These are optimized for CTR while staying accurate and neutral.

Finally, the QA tab provides fact‑checking status, compliance notes, and readability. In production mode, we validate each fact against web sources; in demo mode we mark unverified claims but still provide a complete report structure.

What makes this a production‑grade system is the architecture. Pipelines run concurrently using asyncio, each with timeouts, retries, structured logging, and cost tracking. The UI never blocks, and jobs are fully traceable. You can download individual assets or the entire ZIP in one click.

The impact is massive: 10 hours to 2 minutes, 97 percent cost reduction, and a 10x jump in reach across video, audio, social, and SEO. This is not just automation; it is an editorially safe content multiplication engine designed for HT’s scale.

That is the demo. Happy to dive deeper into the architecture or roadmap next.
